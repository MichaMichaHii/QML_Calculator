# QML Calculator Project

During my internship at Emage Development, I had the opportunity to work on my first ever project using QT/QML. I created a calculator application using the QML language.

It was an exciting experience to dive into the world of QML and learn how to build user interfaces and applications. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience and developed a deeper understanding of QT/QML's capabilities.

I'm proud of the progress I made during my internship and the knowledge I gained while working on this project. I look forward to continuing my journey with QT/QML and exploring more advanced features in the future.
